# Cobrapy_vs_Wolfram_optimization
Discrepancies between the FBA solution obtained by cobra optimization and the FindMaximum module of Wolfram Mathematica
In this repository, we are comparing the FBA results using two optimizers. The first optimizer is the most used one implemented in Cobra. 
The results with other cobra optimizers are the same.  
The other optimizer for FBA is the one implemented in Wolfram-Mathematica version 12 (also version 13).
